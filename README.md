# DiabetesPredictor
The Diabetes Predictor website harnesses the power of machine learning to provide personalized health insights. Utilizing a CSV file containing diverse data points related to diabetes, the platform trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, a robust algorithm capable of identifying intricate patterns within the data. This trained model serves as the backbone of the website's predictive capabilities. Leveraging Streamlit, a user-friendly framework for building interactive web applications, the Diabetes Predictor seamlessly deploys the SVM model onto a sleek and intuitive web interface. Users can input their health metrics, such as blood sugar levels, body mass index, and family history, and receive instant predictions regarding their risk of developing diabetes. By integrating advanced technology with user accessibility, the Diabetes Predictor empowers individuals to take proactive measures towards their health and well-being.
